Greetings
My name is Robin and I'm an 18 year old computer enthusiast from Switzerland.
Ever since I graduated from high school, I have been eagerly looking for a challenge in the form of an apprenticeship in the field of computer science.
My dream is to become a software developer and expand my knowledge and skills in IT and programming.
