							<p>I started a buildup training at an institution called durchstart. Durchstart is an institution that is committed to work integration for young people with mental disabilities and in difficult life situations. To keep myself busy I had to decide on a project that I wanted to do. Considering the future and what kind of project I would ultimately profit off of the most, I decided to program a website with my own portfolio on it with HTML and CSS. Having experience programming would be a huge benefit in my journey to find an apprenticeship as an IT application-developer.</p>

							<p>Having pretty much no prior experience in web-development, I began my endeavours in developing a website relatively simple and watched an HTML course on YouTube. After watching that I knew of some basic HTML tags that I could use to put text on my website. I played around with some tags that were presented in the video to get a feel for what they do and how they could be used. Obviously my website wasn't just going to be some black on white text, so I needed to eventually start using CSS to give my website some life. But that was going to be a problem for another day.</p>
