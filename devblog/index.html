									I started a buildup training at an institution called durchstart.<br />
									Durchstart is an institution that is committed to work integration for young people with mental disabilities and in difficult life situations.<br />
									To keep myself busy I had to decide on a project that I wanted to do.<br />
									Considering the future and what kind of project I would ultimately profit off of the most, I decided to program a website with my own portfolio on it with HTML and CSS.<br />
									Having experience programming would be a huge benefit in my journey to find an apprenticeship as an IT application-developer.

									Having pretty much no prior experience in web-development, I began my endeavours in developing a website relatively simple and watched an HTML course on YouTube.<br />
									After watching that I knew of some basic HTML tags that I could use to put text on my website.<br />
									I played around with some tags that were presented in the video to get a feel for what they do and how they could be used.<br />
									Obviously my website wasn't just going to be some black on white text, so I needed to eventually start using CSS to give my website some life.<br />
									But that was going to be a problem for another day.

									After messaging my brother to get some help with my website he suggested that I should take a look at Bootstrap.<br />
									Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.<br />
									And a framework is a structure that you can build software on. It serves as a foundation, so you're not starting entirely from scratch.<br />
									Also developing a "reponsive" website means using HTML and CSS to automatically resize a website and making it look good on all devices.<br />
									Looking at some of the component-templates they offer it was the perfect base to go off of.<br />
									First thing I started looking at and using was a "Navbar", short for "Navigation Bar". It's bar with clickable links to help users travel around the website.<br />
									Learning more about Bootstrap and using their components and various other tools and classes would definitely be of massive help to get myself onto my feet quicker.

									After completing the initial version of my website, I realized there was still much to learn and improve.<br />
									I decided to enhance the user experience by adding a proper hero section with my photo and call-to-action buttons.<br />
									I also expanded the About Me page with more detailed sections about my journey, skills, and goals.<br />
									The most important addition was creating an archive system to preserve my original work while allowing for future improvements.<br />
									This taught me the importance of version control and documenting my learning process.<br />
									I'm excited to continue building on this foundation and see where my programming journey takes me next.

								Entry 5 | About Me Page Redesign
							</button>
							<div class="contentdevblog max-h-0 overflow-hidden bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-md border border-white/10 border-t-0 rounded-b-2xl transition-all duration-300">
								<p class="pt-6 pb-6 px-6 text-left leading-relaxed">
									I redesigned the About Me page using a three-column grid layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox for better horizontal space utilization.<br />
									The implementation includes a character overview section with profile image integration, a stats system using CSS progress bars with linear gradients and box-shadow effects.<br />
									I restructured the content into distinct panels: character stats (left), skills and abilities (center), and quest log (right), with bottom panels for achievements and journey information.<br />
									The CSS implementation features glassmorphism effects using backdrop-filter: blur() and rgba() backgrounds, with responsive breakpoints at 1200px and 768px for tablet and mobile optimization.<br />
									I added staggered CSS animations using fadeInUp keyframes with delays (0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s) to create a progressive loading sequence.<br />
									The layout maximizes horizontal screen real estate with a 1fr 2fr 1fr grid structure, replacing the previous stacked vertical layout.<br />
									Technical improvements include proper margin spacing (40px bottom margin), consistent color scheme using #00d4ff accent colors, and mobile-first responsive design principles.
