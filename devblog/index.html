							<p class="pt-2">
								I started a buildup training at an institution called durchstart.<br />
								Durchstart is an institution that is committed to work integration for young people with mental disabilities and in difficult life situations.<br />
								To keep myself busy I had to decide on a project that I wanted to do.<br />
								Considering the future and what kind of project I would ultimately profit off of the most, I decided to program a website with my own portfolio on it with HTML and CSS.<br />
								Having experience programming would be a huge benefit in my journey to find an apprenticeship as an IT application-developer.

						<div class="contentdevblog">
							<p class="pt-2">
								Having pretty much no prior experience in web-development, I began my endeavours in developing a website relatively simple and watched an HTML course on YouTube.<br />
								After watching that I knew of some basic HTML tags that I could use to put text on my website.<br />
								I played around with some tags that were presented in the video to get a feel for what they do and how they could be used.<br />
								Obviously my website wasn't just going to be some black on white text, so I needed to eventually start using CSS to give my website some life.<br />
								But that was going to be a problem for another day.

						<button type="button" class="collapsible">Entry 3 | Bootstrap</button>
						<div class="contentdevblog">
							<p class="pt-2">
								After messaging my brother to get some help with my website he suggested that I should take a look at Bootstrap.<br />
								Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.<br />
								And a framework is a structure that you can build software on. It serves as a foundation, so you're not starting entirely from scratch.<br />
								Also developing a "reponsive" website means using HTML and CSS to automatically resize a website and making it look good on all devices.<br />
								Looking at some of the component-templates they offer it was the perfect base to go off of.<br />
								First thing I started looking at and using was a "Navbar", short for "Navigation Bar". It's bar with clickable links to help users travel around the website.<br />
								Learning more about Bootstrap and using their components and various other tools and classes would definitely be of massive help to get myself onto my feet quicker.

						<button type="button" class="collapsible">Entry 4 | Website Improvements</button>
						<div class="contentdevblog">
							<p class="pt-2">
								After completing the initial version of my website, I realized there was still much to learn and improve.<br />
								I decided to enhance the user experience by adding a proper hero section with my photo and call-to-action buttons.<br />
								I also expanded the About Me page with more detailed sections about my journey, skills, and goals.<br />
								The most important addition was creating an archive system to preserve my original work while allowing for future improvements.<br />
								This taught me the importance of version control and documenting my learning process.<br />
								I'm excited to continue building on this foundation and see where my programming journey takes me next.

						<button type="button" class="collapsible">Entry 5 | About Me Page Redesign</button>
						<div class="contentdevblog">
							<p class="pt-2">
								I redesigned the About Me page using a three-column grid layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox for better horizontal space utilization.<br />
								The implementation includes a character overview section with profile image integration, a stats system using CSS progress bars with linear gradients and box-shadow effects.<br />
								I restructured the content into distinct panels: character stats (left), skills and abilities (center), and quest log (right), with bottom panels for achievements and journey information.<br />
								The CSS implementation features glassmorphism effects using backdrop-filter: blur() and rgba() backgrounds, with responsive breakpoints at 1200px and 768px for tablet and mobile optimization.<br />
								I added staggered CSS animations using fadeInUp keyframes with delays (0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s) to create a progressive loading sequence.<br />
								The layout maximizes horizontal screen real estate with a 1fr 2fr 1fr grid structure, replacing the previous stacked vertical layout.<br />
								Technical improvements include proper margin spacing (40px bottom margin), consistent color scheme using #00d4ff accent colors, and mobile-first responsive design principles.
