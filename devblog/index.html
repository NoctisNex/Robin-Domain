							<p>
								I started a buildup training at an institution called durchstart.<br />
								Durchstart is an institution that is committed to work integration for young people with mental disabilities and in difficult life situations.<br />
								To keep myself busy I had to decide on a project that I wanted to do.<br />
								Considering the future and what kind of project I would ultimately profit off of the most, I decided to program a website with my own portfolio on it with HTML and CSS.<br />
								Having experience programming would be a huge benefit in my journey to find an apprenticeship as an IT application-developer.

								Having pretty much no prior experience in web-development, I began my endeavours in developing a website relatively simple and watched an HTML course on YouTube.<br />
								After watching that I knew of some basic HTML tags that I could use to put text on my website.<br />
								I played around with some tags that were presented in the video to get a feel for what they do and how they could be used.<br />
								Obviously my website wasn't just going to be some black on white text, so I needed to eventually start using CSS to give my website some life.<br />
								But that was going to be a problem for another day.

						<div class="contentdevblog">
							<p>
								After messaging my brother to get some help with my website he suggested that I should take a look at Bootstrap.<br />
								Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.<br />
								And a framework is a structure that you can build software on. It serves as a foundation, so you're not starting entirely from scratch.<br />
								Also developing a "reponsive" website means using HTML and CSS to automatically resize a website and making it look good on all devices.<br />
								Looking at some of the component-templates they offer it was the perfect base to go off of.<br />
								First thing I started looking at and using was a "Navbar", short for "Navigation Bar". It's bar with clickable links to help users travel around the website.<br />
								Learning more about Bootstrap and using their components and various other tools and classes would definitely be of massive help to get myself onto my feet quicker.
