## 🚀 A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing my journey into web development

Built with passion by a young computer enthusiast from Switzerland 🇨🇭

---

## 📖 About This Project

This is my personal portfolio website that I created as part of my journey into web development. As a computer enthusiast from Switzerland, I built this website to showcase my skills and document my learning process.

The website originally served as both a professional portfolio and a development blog where I chronicled my experiences learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap from scratch. In October 2025, I refactored the entire project to use **Tailwind CSS**, modernizing the codebase and reducing custom CSS from 1,511 lines to just 59 lines while maintaining all visual design and functionality.
